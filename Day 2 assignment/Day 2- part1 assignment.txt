consosle.log(1+"2"+"2") - It will give 122 as even though an arithmatic operater is present
                          the datatype of the values are differnt so the numbers won't be added
                          1 is a number and "2" is a string.
console.log(1+ +"2"+"2")- It will give 32 an when we put "+ +" the value "2" now acts as an integer
                          so 1+ +"2" gives 3 and then this value 3+"2" gives the output as 32.
console.log(1 + -"1" + "2") - It will give 02 as "+ -" makes "1" an integer so 1 + -"1" gives the
                              value 0 and this value 0 +"2" gives 02 as output.
console.log(+"1" + "1" + "2") - It will be 112 as +"1" make the value "1" as integer 1 and even
                                though an arithmatic operater is present the datatype of the values
                                are differnt so the numbers won't be added. 1 is a number and "2" is
                                a string.
console.log( "A" - "B" + "2") - The output will be "NaN2" as in JavaScript if you are trying to use
                                any operator foe example "-" on string then it will display "NaN".
                                And if you used "+" then it will display two string as together as
                                "NaN2".
console.log( "A" - "B" + 2) - The output will be "NaN" as whenever non numeric values are undergone
                              arithmatic operations then you get "NaN" as return and then when it is
                              added to an integer you will still get Nan.
